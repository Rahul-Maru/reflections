When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You can work on your section of code and only add the other changes when your code is done like merging branches

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are when you copy somebodys remote to a new remote on git with credit and all.
    Clones take a remote or repository and add it to your computer.
    Branches take a commit and put it on another line so you can make different changes to both branches.
    
    Forks are good when you want to take an existing repository and change it but the owner still wants their version.
    Cloning are good when you want to take your remote and copy it on to your computer.
    Branches are good when you try different things that could break the original code or when you want to work on multiple different features but don't know 
    which on you'll end up keeping

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can be up to date with what others working on the repository have done

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    We would work on different parts at one time and efficiency would be a lot easier, but with lots of people, it would be hard to communicate

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you want to work on a new feature or you want to make a pull request but working on the master branch is simpler and less time consuming
